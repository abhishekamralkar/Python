#Every programmin language provides some kind of way of doing numbers and math.
#Simple Mathematics
#Python follows the PEDMAS rule during mathematical calculations PEMDAS, which stands for parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
#It details the order of operations,and also note, 
#In Python we have three types of division, regular division('\'), floor division("\\")  and finding the remainder('%'), 
#Using what's called modulo.
# + Addition
# - Subtraction
# / Division
# * Multiplication
# % Modulus
# < Less Than
# > Greater Than
# <= Less Than Equal
# >= Greater Than Equal
